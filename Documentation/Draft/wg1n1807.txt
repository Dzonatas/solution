1. Abstract

   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
   image/jp2.  The image encoding is defined by [ISO-JPEG2000-1], 
   and the file format to which this document refers is defined in 
   Annex I of [ISO-JPEG2000-1]. Note that a file format is optional 
   in [ISO-JPEG2000-1], but mandatory for the MIME sub-type.  
   This document is not related to the definition of of the MIME
   sub-type image/jpeg which is partly defined by [ISO-JPEG-1] and partly
   by the file format specification defined in [JFIF].  JPEG 2000 is a
   new standard, intended to create a image coding system intended for
   many types of still images (bi-level,gray-level, color, multi-component) 
   with different characteristics (natural images, scientific, medical, 
   remote sensing,imagery, text, rendered graphics, etc.) allowing 
   different imaging models (client/server, real-time transmission, image
   library archival, limited buffer and bandwidth resources, etc.) 
   within a unified system. This coding system is intended to provide 
   low bit-rate operation with rate-distortion and subjective image quality 
   performance superior to existing standards, without sacrificing 
   performance at other points in the rate-distortion spectrum. 
   
   This standard is intended to serve still image compression needs that 
   are currently not served by the current JPEG standards [ISO-JPEG-1],
   [ISO-JPEG-2], [ISO-JPEG-3], and [ISO-JPEG-4], and is intended to compliment, 
   not replace, the current JPEG standards. 

2. JPEG 2000 Definition

   JPEG 2000 is defined in detail in [ISO-JPEG2000-1].  The documentation 
   can be obtained from any national standards body or from ISO at 
   http://www.iso.ch, on publication.  At the date of this RFC the
   document was at the stage of 'Final Committee Draft' and was expected 
   to be submitted in agreed form as IS 15444-1 in late 2000.
   Information as to its latest status, and downloads of the initial
   drafts and some supporting documentation are available through the
   JPEG committee's official Web site at http://www.jpeg.org.  In
   accordance with current ISO policy documents from the Draft
   International Standard stage onwards are only available for purchase
   as noted above.  Should this position change, the JPEG committee affirms
   its intent to make such documentation as freely available as it is able 
   to via its Web site.

   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original JPEG 2000 specification [ISO-JPEG2000-1] to obtain complete 
   feature and technical details.

 2.1 JPEG 2000 Scope

   JPEG 2000 is used to compress image data that typically comes from 
   digital cameras, scanners, frame grabbers, complex image capture 
   devices such as medical or satellite systems, and paint- and photo-
   retouching programs. Unlike previous JPEG standards, it includes
   information necessary to allow its use as a complete coding
   architecture.
   [ISO-JPEG2000-1] defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy 
   compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, grey-scale, 
   or colour digital still images.  It therefore:
   
   — specifies decoding processes for converting compressed image data 
     to reconstructed image data
   
   — specifies a codestream syntax containing information for 
     interpreting the compressed image data
   
   — specifies a file format
   
   — provides guidance on encoding processes for converting source 
     image data to compressed image data
   
   — provides guidance on how to implement these processes in practice
   
   [ISO-JPEG2000-1] is one of a series of standards which will cover the
   full range of facilities the new architecture is intended to offer.
   Approval has been given for JPEG to develop the following documents
   in addition to [ISO-JPEG2000-1].
   
   - Part 2 - Coding extensions.  This will include a more comprehensive
      file format and other extensions to the definitions in
      [ISO-JPEG2000-1]
      
   - Part 3 - Motion JPEG 2000.  This provides definitions of how the
     standard may be extended for use in recording time series of JPEG
     2000 images with associated metadata such as audio objects
     
   - Part 4 - Conformance.  This deals with testing of equipment and
     systems claimed to conform to the JPEG 2000 standards
     
   - Part 5 - Reference software.  This will provide developers with a
     source of publicly available reference software.  Its role is envisaged
     as similar in concept to that played by the Independent JPEG Group (IJG)
     in publicising the current [ISO-JPEG-1] standard.

2.2 JPEG 2000 Features

   Some of the features of JPEG 2000 include:

    - JPEG 2000 is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color,
      and full-color image data in several color spaces

    - JPEG 2000 includes a number of compression schemes that allow
      developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
      applications

    - JPEG 2000 is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as new
      needs arise

    - JPEG 2000 allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or
      special-purpose information within the metadata of its file format

    These are features that JPEG 2000 shares with the definition of TIFF
    [RFC-TIFF].  In addition, JPEG 20000 offers:
    
    - state of the art lossless and lossy compression, based on wavelet
      technology, within a single codestream
      
    - low bit-rate compression performance effective down to below 0.25
      bits per pixel for high resolution grey-scale images
    
    - large image handling (greater than 64k x 64k pixels) without
      tiling
    
    - single decompression architecture. The current JPEG standard 
      [ISO-JPEG-1] has 44 modes, many of which are application specific 
      and not used by the majority of JPEG decoders. 
      
    - features to improve transmission in noisy environments, for
      example mobile radio / telephony
      
    - capability to handle both natural and computer generated imagery

3. MIME Definition

3.1 image/jp2

   The image/jp2 content-type refers to all of the profiles and
   extensions that build on the JP2 file format defined in Annex I of
   the JPEG 2000 standard [ISO-JPEG2000-1].
   The recommended file suffix is "jp2"

4.  IANA Registration

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/jp2

   MIME media type name: image

   MIME subtype name: jp2

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

      It is up to the implementation to determine the application 
      (if necessary) and render the image to the user.

   Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred

   Security considerations:

      JPEG 2000 utilizes a structure which can store image data and
      metadata coresponding to this image data.   The fields defined 
      in the JPEG 2000 standards are of a descriptive nature and provide
      information that may be useful to facilitate viewing,
      rendering and cataloging of images by a recipient.  
      As such, the fields currently defined in the JPEG 2000 
      standards do not in themselves create additional security 
      risks, since the fields are not used to induce any particular 
      behavior by the recipient application.  It should be noted that
      selected metadata filed may encompass information partly intended 
      to protect the image against unauthorised use or distribution.  In
      this case alteration or removal of this data may constitute an
      offence under national agreements based on WIPO treaties.

      JPEG 2000 has an extensible structure, so that it is
      theoretically possible that metadata fields could be defined 
      in the future which could be used to induce particular actions on
      the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional
      security risks, but this type of capability is currently not
      supported in the referenced JPEG 2000 specification. 

   Interoperability considerations:

      The ability of implementations to handle all the defined
      applications (or profiles within applications) of JPEG 2000 may
      not be ubiquitous.  As a result, implementations may decode
      and attempt to display the encoded JPEG 2000 image data only to
      determine that the image cannot be rendered either partially or 
      in full.  It is intended to register further mime types to handle
      the additional capabilities present in [ISO-JPEG2000-2], 
      [ISO-JPEG2000-3], [ISO-JPEG2000-4] and any further parts of
      the standard that might be created in future.

   Published specification:

      JPEG 2000 is define in 
      IS 15444-1 should be published by ISO in 2001.
